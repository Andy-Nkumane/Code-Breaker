*Helpful Strategic Hint*

The point of this game is to break the hidden code in as
few tries as possible. It is important to view the 
feedback provided before you try entering a new code.
That way, you can minimize the number of mistakes you
make at the same time gaining knowledge of the 
hidden code. A good approach is to shift two or 
three digits in the code at a time in order to narrow them
down in the correct position.

As always, try having fun and don't give up. This is a 
game of strategy and deep thinking.
