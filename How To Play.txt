*How To Play*

The game is very simple and easy to play. At the
beginning, enter a code based on the required length
and check your entry to compare it with the hidden
code. The feedback provided is the number of digits in the
correct position and the number of digits in the 
incorrect position.

Here is an example:

	The hidden code is:
	1234
	The code entered is:
	6243
	The feedback you get is:
		-In Position = 1
		-Out of Position = 2

As you can see, the (2) is in the correct position, but the
(3) and (4) are not. All you can do at this point is shift
some numbers around and try to figure out which ones
are in the right position.

If you decide to give up, just click on the Answer button
and it will display the hidden code.
