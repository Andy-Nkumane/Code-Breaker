*How It Works*

The hidden code is randomly generated (you can't see it of
course) and you have two options for play based on 
difficulty: a specified number of tries based on the 
difficulty level or an unlimited amount of tries.

All you need to do is enter a code equal to the selected
difficulty level/length and compare it with the hidden
code. Each try is recorded in a list with feedback.

Each indivitaul digit in the hidden code is different from
the others, which means each digit does not repeat 
within the hidden code.
